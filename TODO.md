# TODOS

- make sure to secure the app against group id guessing attacks
- check how to scan th qr code on the phone if you have the app on the phone and add that info to the app somewhere
- consumption calculations not working (per unit stuff)
- add option to set weigths per expense in member editor
- problem with consumptions: if 2 people use the sauna and 1 person is 1h and 1 person is 2h of a total usage of 2h. Should the first person only pay half of the first hour? Probably add a mode to individually set the usage and  then calculate partially like first hour where 2 users so it is split between 2, second hour was only 1 user so it is fully paid by this user. This also applies to car usage by km. => add option to set individual usages per unit at consumptions add add description (!)
