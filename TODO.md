# TODOS

- make sure to secure the app against group id guessing attacks
- make sure all dates are stored with same time (00:00)
- Layout bug with "Default" badge for defualt weight type on create group dialog and section (exceeds row). Also Add weight type button too large. Unifiy group settings and group dialog. 
- language sometimes falls back to english (even though german was manually picked by url). E.g when adding a member
- include language switcher in burger menu
- reorganize burger menu (get rid of sections, fix layout of theme switcher which is off), add option to create new group
- implement join group dialog / and change share link to open a "who are you" dialog that allows to pick or create a member or say "I'm not part of the group"
  - if there is an identity default paid by in expenses to that person and show name with "(Me)" whereever it appears
- make layout of home page same width as group view and add top bar
- do not autofocus inputs on edit
- member editor: initialize selected members
- member editor: only allow to edit weights if "custom" is selected. Make sure it works on mobile (currently it hides the member name, because the weight input is too large)
- allow to submit by pressing enter 
- setting for groups to disable active from / active to for members and also disable / enable recurring expenses (make ui as easy as possible and as complicated as necessary)
- add default weight type when creating a resource
- allow to link a resource to a member (to include the resource in the member balance)
- when creating settlemetns allow to specify special transactions (person A pays person B) which then ignores person A in the settlements an creates this settelment transaction like specified
- consumption: autoselect resource (if only 1)
- add view to see all payments / consumptsion of a member
- in the "split between" on consumptions and expenses view, highlight the name (its hard to read), also do not show 0 amounts
- add select all to member editor
