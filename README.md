- `pnpm docker:deploy:up <name>` - Deploy an existing configuration

## Database Schema

The app uses the following main entities:

- **Groups**: Expense sharing groups with currency and weight settings
- **Members**: People in each group with weights, active periods, and contact info
- **Expenses**: Individual expenses with amounts, dates, and recurring options
- **ExpenseMembers**: Junction table for expense splitting with custom amounts
- **Resources**: Shared resources (utilities, groceries, etc.) with unit pricing
- **Consumptions**: Resource usage tracking with member allocation
- **ConsumptionMembers**: Junction table for consumption splitting
- **Settlements**: Settlement records for balancing payments
- **SettlementMembers**: Individual settlement transactions between members/resources

## How to Use

1. **Create a Group**: Click "Create Group" on the homepage and configure settings
2. **Add Members**: Add friends and family with optional weights and contact information
3. **Track Expenses**: Add expenses with automatic splitting or custom amounts
4. **Manage Resources**: Create shared resources like utilities or groceries
5. **Log Consumption**: Track resource usage and split costs among members
6. **Generate Settlements**: Create optimized settlement plans to balance all debts
7. **Share**: Share the group link with others to let them join

## Development

### Database Management

The app uses Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL development:

```bash
# Start database
pnpm db:start

# Stop database
pnpm db:stop

# Reset database (removes all data)
pnpm db:reset
```

Or use Docker Compose directly:

```bash
# Start database
docker compose up -d postgres

# Stop database
docker compose down

# Reset database (removes all data)
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d postgres
```

### Prisma Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
pnpm db:generate

# Push schema changes to database
pnpm db:push

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
pnpm db:studio
```

### Docker Deployment

The application includes a flexible deployment system that allows you to create and manage multiple deployment configurations:

#### Create a New Deployment
```bash
# Interactive deployment creation
pnpm docker:deploy:create
```

This command will:
- Prompt for a deployment name
- Ask you to choose a proxy type (nginx, traefik, or custom)
- Collect domain and admin email information
- Optionally ask for a Docker Host (for remote deployments)
- Generate a complete deployment configuration in `deployments/<name>/`

#### Deploy an Existing Configuration
```bash
# Deploy a specific configuration
pnpm docker:deploy:up <deployment_name>
```

This command will:
- Pull the latest Docker images
- Start the services using the specified deployment configuration
- Use the DOCKER_HOST if specified in the deployment's .env file

#### Deployment Types

**Nginx Proxy**
- Uses `jwilder/nginx-proxy` for automatic reverse proxy
- Includes `jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion` for SSL certificates
- Creates its own `nginx_network`

**Traefik Proxy**
- Uses `traefik:v3.5.2` for reverse proxy and load balancing
- Automatic SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt
- Creates its own `traefik_network`
- Includes Traefik dashboard on port 8080

**Custom Proxy**
- Uses an external proxy network
- You specify the network name during creation
- Useful for integrating with existing proxy setups

#### Remote Deployment
To deploy to a remote Docker host:
1. Create a deployment with a custom Docker Host
2. The deployment will use the specified DOCKER_HOST for all Docker operations
3. Make sure the remote host has access to the required Docker images

#### Managing Deployments
Once deployed, you can manage your deployment using standard Docker Compose commands:

```bash
# View logs
docker compose -f deployments/<name>/docker-compose.yml --env-file deployments/<name>/.env logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose -f deployments/<name>/docker-compose.yml --env-file deployments/<name>/.env down

# Restart services
docker compose -f deployments/<name>/docker-compose.yml --env-file deployments/<name>/.env restart

# View status
docker compose -f deployments/<name>/docker-compose.yml --env-file deployments/<name>/.env ps
```

#### Examples

**Create a production deployment with nginx:**
```bash
pnpm docker:deploy:create
# Enter deployment name: production
# Choose proxy type: 1 (nginx)
# Enter domain: myapp.example.com
# Enter admin email: admin@example.com
# Docker Host: (leave empty for local)
```

**Deploy to a remote server:**
```bash
pnpm docker:deploy:create
# Enter deployment name: remote-prod
# Choose proxy type: 2 (traefik)
# Enter domain: myapp.example.com
# Enter admin email: admin@example.com
# Docker Host: ssh://user@remote-server:22
```

**Deploy the configuration:**
```bash
pnpm docker:deploy:up production
```

For more detailed information about the deployment system, see the [deployments/README.md](deployments/README.md) file.
