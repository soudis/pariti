## Database Schema

The app uses the following main entities:

- **Groups**: Expense sharing groups with currency and weight settings
- **Members**: People in each group with weights, active periods, and contact info
- **Expenses**: Individual expenses with amounts, dates, and recurring options
- **ExpenseMembers**: Junction table for expense splitting with custom amounts
- **Resources**: Shared resources (utilities, groceries, etc.) with unit pricing
- **Consumptions**: Resource usage tracking with member allocation
- **ConsumptionMembers**: Junction table for consumption splitting
- **Settlements**: Settlement records for balancing payments
- **SettlementMembers**: Individual settlement transactions between members/resources

## How to Use

1. **Create a Group**: Click "Create Group" on the homepage and configure settings
2. **Add Members**: Add friends and family with optional weights and contact information
3. **Track Expenses**: Add expenses with automatic splitting or custom amounts
4. **Manage Resources**: Create shared resources like utilities or groceries
5. **Log Consumption**: Track resource usage and split costs among members
6. **Generate Settlements**: Create optimized settlement plans to balance all debts
7. **Share**: Share the group link with others to let them join

## Development

### Database Management

The app uses Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL development:

```bash
# Start database
pnpm db:start

# Stop database
pnpm db:stop

# Reset database (removes all data)
pnpm db:reset
```

Or use Docker Compose directly:

```bash
# Start database
docker compose up -d postgres

# Stop database
docker compose down

# Reset database (removes all data)
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d postgres
```

### Prisma Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
pnpm db:generate

# Push schema changes to database
pnpm db:push

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
pnpm db:studio
```

### Docker Deployment

The application includes comprehensive Docker deployment support with multiple proxy configurations:

#### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Deploy with Nginx proxy
pnpm docker:deploy:nginx

# Deploy with Traefik proxy
pnpm docker:deploy:traefik
```

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
cd docker
./deploy.sh nginx  # or traefik
```

#### Updating Existing Deployment
```bash
# Update to latest image
pnpm docker:update

# Update to specific image tag
./scripts/update.sh nginx v1.2.3

# Interactive update (prompts for options)
./scripts/update.sh
```

The deployment script will:
- Generate secure database credentials
- Prompt for domain and admin email
- Create environment configuration
- Deploy with SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- Set up reverse proxy configuration

The update script will:
- Pull the latest Docker image
- Stop the application container (preserves database)
- Start the application with the new image
- Provide rollback capability if update fails
- Show deployment status and logs
